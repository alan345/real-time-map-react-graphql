# Subscriptions Example (with React & Apollo)

A realtime chat application that displays the locations of all the chat participants on a map.

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/): Frontend framework for building user interfaces
* [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client): Fully-featured, production ready caching GraphQL client
* [Graphcool](https://www.graph.cool): Flexible backend platform combining GraphQL + AWS Lambda

## Getting Started

Subscriptions allow you to bring realtime functionality into your app. You can learn more about subscriptions in our [docs](https://www.graph.cool/docs/reference/simple-api/subscriptions-aip7oojeiv/).


### 1. Clone example repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/graphcool-examples/react-graphql.git
cd react-graphql/subscriptions-with-apollo-worldchat
```

### 2. Create Graphcool service with the [Graphcool CLI](https://docs-next.graph.cool/reference/graphcool-cli/overview-zboghez5go)

```sh
# Install Graphcool Framework CLI
npm install -g graphcool@next

# Create a new service inside a directory called `server`
graphcool init server
```

This created the following file structure in the current directory:

```
.
└── server
    ├── graphcool.yml
    ├── types.graphql
    └── src
        ├── hello.graphql
        └── hello.js
```

### 3. Define data model

Next, you need to define your data model inside the newly created `types.graphql`-file.

Replace the current contents in `types.graphql` with the following type definition (you can delete the predefined `User` type):

```graphql
type Traveller @model {
  # Required system field
  id: ID! @isUnique # read-only (managed by Graphcool)

  # Optional system fields (remove if not needed)
  createdAt: DateTime! # read-only (managed by Graphcool)
  updatedAt: DateTime! # read-only (managed by Graphcool)

  name: String!
  location: Location! @relation(name: "TravellerLocation")
  messages: [Message!]! @relation(name: "MessagesFromTraveller")
}

type Message @model {
  # Required system field
  id: ID! @isUnique # read-only (managed by Graphcool)

  # Optional system fields (remove if not needed)
  createdAt: DateTime! # read-only (managed by Graphcool)
  updatedAt: DateTime! # read-only (managed by Graphcool)

  text: String!
  sentBy: Traveller!  @relation(name: "MessagesFromTraveller")
}

type Location @model {
  # Required system field
  id: ID! @isUnique # read-only (managed by Graphcool)

  # Optional system fields (remove if not needed)
  createdAt: DateTime! # read-only (managed by Graphcool)
  updatedAt: DateTime! # read-only (managed by Graphcool)

  traveller: Traveller! @relation(name: "TravellerLocation")
  latitude: Float!
  longitude: Float!
}
```

### 4. Deploy the GraphQL server

You're now ready to put your Graphcool service into production! Navigate into the `server` directory and [deploy](https://docs-next.graph.cool/reference/graphcool-cli/commands-aiteerae6l#graphcool-deploy) the service:

```sh
cd server
graphcool deploy
```

Save the HTTP endpoint for the `Simple API` from the output as well as the websocket endpoint for the `Subscriptions API`, you'll need them in the next step.

> **Note**: You can now test your GraphQL API inside a GraphQL playground. Simply type the `graphcool playground` command and start sending queries and mutations.

### 5. Connect the app with your GraphQL API

#### 5.1. Simple API

Copy the `Simple API` endpoint to `./src/App.js` as the `uri` argument in the `createNetworkInterface` call:

```js
const networkInterface = createNetworkInterface({ uri: '__SIMPLE_API_ENDPOINT__' })
```

#### 5.2. Subscriptions API

Copy the `Subscriptions API` endpoint to `./src/App.js` as the argument for the constructor of the `SubscriptionClient`:

```js
const wsClient = new SubscriptionClient('__SUBSCRIPTIONS_API_ENDPOINT__')
```

> **Note**: If you ever lose your endpoints, you can get access to them again with the `graphcool info` command.

### 6. Install dependencies & run locally

You're done configuring the example application. 

```sh
yarn install
yarn start # open browser with: http://localhost:3000
```
